    <h4 class="odd">DESCRIPTION</h4><br>

    This little module has a single purpose: to help you build in your site an editorial column section, where you can
    manage the columns and articles published in an ordered fashion.<br><br>

    It uses Smarty templates, can take comments, it's fully searchable, includes notification options, and lets users
    rate the articles as well as send private messages to the authors. Also, you can
    decide which groups of users see what specific columns.<br><br>
